## What You May Change Freely

The following changes may be made without special approval, subject to normal review:

## What Requires Explicit Review

Please request review for changes involving:

## How to Propose Changes

Disagreement is expected. Erasure is discouraged.

## Stewardship Ethic

This commons is maintained in the spirit of care, restraint, and hospitality.

Contributors are expected to improve the work, not dominate it, extract from it, or convert it into a personal platform.

If you are unsure whether a change belongs here, propose it rather than force it.
