# Cooperative & Mutual Aid Knowledge Commons

## Purpose

Many efforts in cooperation, mutual aid, and community health fail not because of lack of goodwill, but because knowledge, governance, and responsibility are not documented in ways that can be maintained, adapted, or inherited.

This project exists to turn lived experience, essays, and practical models into a public, maintainable knowledge commons that others can improve, test, and carry forward across generations.

This is not a software project. It is maintained using software practices.

## What This Project Is Not

To prevent confusion and mission drift, this project is not:

- A software product  
- A political platform or campaign  
- A charity brand or fundraising vehicle  
- A closed doctrine or ideology  
- A replacement for local judgment or lived conditions  

This is a commons, not an authority.

## Scope

This repository contains materials related to:

- Cooperative governance and membership structures  
- Mutual aid grounded in proximity, obligation, and care  
- Community-based healthcare and patient–physician cooperation  
- Failures caused by abstraction in law, finance, and administration  
- Case studies documenting what was tried, what worked, and what failed  

All material should be grounded in practice or direct observation.

---

## How to Use This Repository

- Read and adapt freely
- Propose changes through pull requests
- Create parallel documents when disagreement exists
- Document failures as carefully as successes

You do not need permission to experiment. You do need to document what you learn.

## Maintenance Assumptions

- Long development timelines are assumed  
- No contributor is expected to be permanent  
- Burnout is treated as a design failure  
- Stability is valued over novelty  
- Clarity is valued over cleverness
