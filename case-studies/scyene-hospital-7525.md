# A Hospital That Should Not Have Failed
## Scyene, Power, and the Erasure of Care at 7525 Scyene Road

## A Brief History of Scyene

Scyene was a small town in east-central Dallas County, Texas, located approximately ten miles east-southeast of downtown Dallas. Today it survives only as a neighborhood of East Dallas, just west of Mesquite.

Its historical boundaries were South Sam Houston Road and Cheyenne Road on the east, Military Parkway on the north, North Prairie Creek on the west, and Bruton Road on the south. The town center stood at the intersection of Scyene Road and North Saint Augustine Drive.

Scyene was officially established in 1854 with the construction of a post office. Before that, it had been known as Thorpville or Prairie Creek. The name “Scyene” evolved from an early proposal, “Seine,” suggested by James Beeman, then spelled “Sceyne” by residents before settling into its current form.

During the Civil War, Scyene became briefly notorious. Jesse and Frank James, Cole and Bob Younger, and Myra Shirley—later known as Belle Starr—moved there in 1864. Many of these Missouri–Kansas border outlaws did not survive their violent lives.

At its peak in 1873, Scyene had a population of roughly 300, a Masonic lodge, a wagon factory, and six saloons. That same year, however, the Texas and Pacific Railway bypassed the town after Scyene refused to finance its own depot. The railroad instead built in Mesquite, which flourished. Scyene declined.

By 1940, Scyene had fifty residents and two businesses. By 1950, when it was annexed by the City of Dallas, it had 155 residents and two businesses. Like many places that declined not through failure but through bypass, it never recovered its institutional footing.

## The Hospital

In 1973, a 124-bed facility called **East Town Osteopathic Hospital** was built at 7525 Scyene Road. For decades it served as the area’s only hospital.

In the 1990s, the hospital expanded using approximately $18 million in nonprofit bond financing. As part of that financing, management control was granted to a Florida-based surgery center management company, Evercare, which extracted a management fee of approximately $100,000 per month from hospital revenues.

Over time, local trustees observed a decline in physician admissions and growing dissatisfaction among medical staff. When the trustees attempted to terminate the Evercare contract, bondholders refused.

The hospital was reorganized under the **Tri-City** banner in 1999 and continued operating until 2006.

During its final seven years, the hospital collected approximately $70 million in revenue but reported a cumulative loss of roughly $3 million. In 2006, citing reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, Tri-City Health Centre Inc. abruptly closed the facility.

More than 400 employees lost their jobs.
A community of nearly 60,000 people lost its only hospital.

## Abandonment by Design

After the closure, the property passed through multiple owners who treated it as speculative real estate rather than civic infrastructure. No serious effort was made to secure, clean, or repurpose the site.

From 2006 to 2018, the City of Dallas took no meaningful enforcement action. No cleanup occurred. No security was provided. No remediation was required.

Despite sensational newspaper coverage and repeated expressions of concern, the City collected no fines and ordered no repairs.

## What the City Claimed

In a 2018 lawsuit, City attorneys described hazardous conditions allegedly discovered during a 2017 inspection: drug use, combustible materials, exposed wiring, broken glass, open elevator shafts, and other dangers.

These conditions were cited as justification for demolition.

Yet when the City took control of the property in 2018, it did nothing to address those hazards. Notably, despite decades of abandonment, no serious injuries had been reported on the site in over fifty years.

A City Council member described the building as “a 108,990-square-foot code violation” and “a nightmare,” emphasizing appearance over function.

## The Feasibility of Reuse

Prior to City control, the property was acquired by **New Start Foundation**, a church whose pastor sought to convert it into a school and transitional housing for foster youth.

The foundation borrowed $500,000 based on the City’s own tax valuation of the property. That amount was insufficient even to begin asbestos remediation. The City’s lawsuit made further financing impossible.

After foreclosure, lienholders purchased the property at auction in 2019 for $400,000, despite a listed tax value of $1.2 million.

The court required asbestos removal, site cleanup, and building security before title could be cleared. These requirements were met between June and December of 2019. City engineers inspected the work and approved it. A reconstruction and partial demolition permit was issued and remains in effect.

Professional inspections by contractors, architects, engineers, and healthcare developers confirmed that the original hospital structure was sound. Built on bedrock, with concrete and steel anchored directly into rock, the structure retained substantial value.

Retaining it would have saved approximately six months of construction time and roughly $18 million in materials alone.

## Interruption and Escalation

Design and planning proceeded for six months. Then COVID-19 halted development, disrupted supply chains, and dramatically increased construction costs.

By mid-2022, approximately $4 million had been invested in cleanup, planning, engineering, and compliance.

At that point, despite prior approvals, the City filed suit seeking demolition within thirty days or full construction within a year. No lender would finance a project under an active demolition order.

The City offered no expert testimony regarding feasibility, safety, or cost.

---

## Incentives and Power

The City’s stated rationales—appearance, speed, nuisance—did not align with prior approvals or factual conditions. No alternative plan existed. No redevelopment followed.

Demolition, however, aligned neatly with political incentives. It appeared in campaign materials as an accomplishment after litigation began.

In April 2023, municipal court ordered demolition without expert testimony and despite unresolved factual disputes. The case was appealed.

In 2025, the hospital was demolished.

Nothing is planned for the site.
The land is empty.
The need is not.

## Understanding Hospital Failure

Hospitals fail in two ways. Some fail because they are no longer needed. Others fail because they are no longer tolerated.

This hospital failed for the second reason.

It stood in the wrong place, served the wrong people, and required patience in a system trained to reward speed, appearance, and control.

Absence is not resolution. Illness does not vanish when concrete is removed. It waits.

## From Institutions That Fail to Care That Endures

The destruction of a hospital does not end the story of care. It reveals where care has been misplaced.

Healthcare organized around large institutions scales well but remembers poorly. When institutions lose memory, care migrates—into distant emergency rooms, unpaid family labor, postponed diagnoses, and silent decline.

The failure here was not medical. It was relational.

## The Patient and the Systems That Tried to Care for Him

He was thirteen when his encounters with care systems began. They lasted nearly twenty years.

After a severe motorcycle accident, chronic pain followed him into adulthood. Medication became constant because it was never unnecessary.

Mental illness was diagnosed late. Legal supervision was inconsistent. Systems drifted in and out of his life.

At thirty-three, he died from hydrocodone.

No single decision caused his death. No institution alone failed him. Together, they formed a corridor with no exits.

---

## What This Story Asks of Us

This story does not ask for outrage. It asks for attention.

Modern systems excel at intervention. They fail at accompaniment.

When care is fragmented, patients are expected to carry coherence themselves. For those with pain, illness, or legal entanglement, this expectation is cruel.

The patient did not need better management.
He needed people who stayed.

This is the moral limit of centralized care.

## Closing Reflection

Health does not exist in episodes. Neither does illness.

Systems built around transactions will always miss what unfolds between them.

This story does not demand sympathy.
It demands redesign.
