# The Triumph of Abstraction
## Abstraction as Moral Technology

### Overview

Most of the damage humans do to one another is not done out of cruelty. It is done out of distance.

We build structures to manage conflict, distribute responsibility, and limit harm. Over time, those structures grow elaborate. They acquire rules, offices, credentials, procedures, and language of their own. Eventually, they become so complex that no single person can see through them, and no one within them feels fully responsible for what they produce. At that point, harm no longer looks like a decision. It looks like an outcome.

Abstraction is the tool that makes this possible.

## Abstraction as a Tool

Abstraction allows us to act without fully encountering the consequences of our actions. It converts people into cases, injuries into claims, deaths into statistics, and responsibility into compliance. Abstraction is not a mistake; it is a technology. It was invented to prevent worse things from happening.

Human societies did not stumble into systems of law, medicine, finance, and governance by accident. These systems arose from convenience, fear, and failure. Rules replaced retaliation. Process replaced violence. Distance was introduced where proximity proved dangerous.

In this sense, abstraction is both a moral and an immoral achievement. A contract is safer than a threat. A court is safer than a mob. A form is safer than a fight. These are not trivial gains. History has already tested them, and they work as intended.

The trouble begins when the tool outgrows its purpose.

## When Process Replaces Judgment

When abstraction becomes the primary way a society understands itself, it no longer merely contains violence; it conceals it. Harm persists, but it is diffused across offices, policies, and timelines. No one intended it. Everyone followed the rules.

The result is suffering without an author.

Success becomes measured by process rather than outcome. The question shifts from whether something is true or humane to whether it was done correctly. Compliance replaces judgment. Defensibility replaces understanding.

This shift is not limited to courts. It appears in healthcare that treats bodies as billing units, in education that measures learning by proxies, in economics that reduces survival to market participation, and in governance that manages populations rather than communities. Abstraction promises neutrality and delivers distance.

This is not an argument against order. It is an examination of what happens when mechanisms designed to prevent catastrophe become substitutes for care.

## Court: Order Without Understanding

Court provides a visible example of this transformation.

The formality of court may exist not to deliver justice, but to make its absence survivable. The system demands restraint because restraint is all it can reliably produce.

Court is the compromise humanity reached when killing one another over grievances proved too expensive and too final. In that sense, court works. It replaces violence with ceremony.

Yet when witnessing a trial, justice is difficult to find. What appears instead is order: who may speak, when they may speak, which words are permitted, which facts are excluded. The question is not *what happened* but *what can be proven under these rules, at this time, by these people*.

Justice wears a blindfold. We are told this represents impartiality, but it may also represent ignorance. The scale weighs representations, not truth. Judges choose between abstractions, not between realities.

## The Myth of Free Talk

I imagine a room where stories could be told fully and listened to carefully. That vision belongs to movies.

Free talk is not justice. It favors the powerful, the eloquent, the prepared, and the shameless. Emotion overwhelms fact. Confidence masquerades as truth. Law arose not because people wanted justice, but because they wanted predictability.

Predictability requires constraint.

So we built systems, and then systems to regulate systems. What began as an attempt to contain violence became an architecture so complex that justice itself became an unintended side effect.

Court is not designed for wisdom. It is designed to prevent catastrophe.

---

## Continuity Over Truth

History offers little comfort. Power rarely submits to procedure unless it has already lost. Many who deserved justice never saw it. What remains is not reconciliation but record.

Perhaps that is all court ever truly provides: continuity. The world goes on. The files are closed. The record is made. Whether justice entered the room is left for later generations to debate safely.

## When Abstraction Becomes Belief
### (Richard Cory)

It is difficult to stop replaying the Simon and Garfunkel song *Richard Cory*, adapted from Edwin Arlington Robinson’s poem.

Robinson asks how little we know about one another. Simon asks why we believe wealth equals happiness, and why we are forced to believe it. This is the fault line I return to: material success mistaken for human flourishing.

We watched Richard Cory pass. We did not walk with him. Watching is safer. It lets envy dress itself as admiration.

Money is loud even when it is quiet. It does not tell you what keeps a man awake.

The mistake is assuming that visible order means inner peace. That polish is proof. Grace does not follow money. It arrives, if at all, through proximity and care.

Richard Cory went home alone. Not the bullet, but the going home matters most. Empty rooms do not save people.

He is not a warning against wealth. He is a warning against distance.

We failed each other by never asking who he was, and by never saying who we were. That failure repeats quietly. It becomes another abstraction, one we have not yet accepted personally.

## Closing Reflection

To notice the limits of abstraction is not to reject it. It is to ask what must exist alongside it if humans are to live together without slowly forgetting one another.

Abstraction keeps the world running. Whether it makes it just is another question.
