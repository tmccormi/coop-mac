# Continuity Is Care
## A Principle Extracted from the Failure at 7525 Scyene Road

### Statement of the Principle

Care that does not persist over time is not care; it is intervention.

Healthcare systems that treat illness as a series of isolated events may deliver competent services in moments, yet still fail patients whose needs unfold across years. When responsibility is divided among institutions that do not retain memory, continuity is lost, and care migrates into absence.

Continuity is not an enhancement to care.
It is a prerequisite.

## What Continuity Means

Continuity is the sustained holding of a person’s history, context, and vulnerability over time.

It includes:
- Memory of prior injury, treatment, and failure
- Recognition of patterns rather than episodes
- Responsibility that does not reset at institutional boundaries
- Presence that persists after discharge, judgment, or compliance

Continuity cannot be automated without being diminished. It requires people who remain accountable to one another across changes in condition, setting, and status.

## How Continuity Is Lost

Modern healthcare systems are optimized for transactions:
- Visits
- Procedures
- Claims
- Discharges
- Compliance events

Each transaction may be competently executed. The failure occurs between them.

When responsibility is fragmented:
- No one is charged with holding the whole person
- Memory is externalized into records no one fully inhabits
- Patients are expected to coordinate their own care
- Those least able to do so carry the greatest burden

This is not neglect by intent.
It is abandonment by accumulation.

## Institutional Failure Without Malice

Systems that lose continuity do not fail because they are cruel. They fail because they are distant.

Each institution operates within its mandate:
- The hospital treats injury
- The psychiatrist treats symptoms
- The court enforces rules
- The prison enforces sentences

Each then releases the person back into fragmentation.

No single decision causes harm.
Together, they create a corridor with no exits.

## Why Centralization Makes This Worse

As systems scale, memory becomes expensive.

Large institutions preserve data but lose relationship. When care is centralized:
- Responsibility becomes conditional
- Help is offered when criteria are met and withdrawn when they are not
- Patients who relapse, move slowly, or carry multiple labels fall through gaps

Efficiency increases. Care thins.

This is the moral limit of centralized care.

---

## What Continuity Requires

Continuity requires structures that:
- Are small enough to remember people
- Are stable enough to persist over time
- Are shared enough that responsibility does not vanish with role changes
- Value presence over throughput

Continuity is not nostalgia.
It is governance at human scale.

---

## Implications

Any healthcare reform that does not account for continuity will reproduce the same failures, regardless of technology, funding, or policy.

Continuity cannot be added later.
It must be designed in from the beginning.

## Cross-Reference

This principle is grounded in the case documented at:

- **A Hospital That Should Not Have Failed**
  `/case-studies/scyene-hospital-7525.md`

That case should be read as evidence, not illustration.
